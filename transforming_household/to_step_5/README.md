One file in this directory is this README.md file.

Six files in this directory are from steps 1 and 2, and are included here, to be complete.

- `06724-0001-Data.txt`
- `06724-Codebook.pdf` 
- `robbins_etl_example_06724-0001-Data-Crosswalk-1994.xlsx`
- `robbins_etl_example_06724-0001-Data-1994.xlsx`
- `robbins_etl_example_06724-0001-Data-Analysis-1994.accdb`
- `robbins_etl_example_06724-0001-Data-Analysis-1994.xlsx`

Two files in this directory were developed in step 3:

- `robbinsr_etl_06724-0001-Data-Code-Tables-Design-1994.vsdx`
- `robbinsr_etl_06724-0001-Data-Code-Tables-Design-1994.pdf`

These are described below.

`robbinsr_etl_06724-0001-Data-Code-Tables-Design-1994.vsdx` is a Microsoft Visio file where entity relationship diagrams were built. One diagram focuses on identifying the primary key of the household table that will be built and populated in Oracle. Another four diagrams focus on identifying the foreign keys that will exist in the household table. These diagrams also identify the tables that are pointed to by the household table's foreign keys. Another diagram focuses on identifying the fields in household that are associated with counts, which will be stored as integers. Finally, a last diagram indicates fields that either have not been addressed yet, or will not be addressed.

`robbinsr_etl_06724-0001-Data-Code-Tables-Design-1994.pdf` is a file which is a pdf document so that the diagrams can be viewed in a pdf viewer or can be printed.
